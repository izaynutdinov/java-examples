# Iskandar Zaynutdinov's Java Examples

This is the collection of my Java Example projects. I developed it to remember Java/Web/Spring programming, because I had more 2 years break with Java EE Development. I wonder if someone will find it useful. But, I hope so.

This project includes the following subprojects:
